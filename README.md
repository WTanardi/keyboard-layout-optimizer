## TBN - An alternative keyboard layout specifically tailored for Bahasa Indonesia

## Introduction

TBN is an alternative keyboard layout specifically designed to be ergonomic and
efficient in typing in Bahasa Indonesia. This project is initiated by the fact
that there are hasn't been a single alternative layout tailored for Bahasa
Indonesia. Dvorak, Colemak, and Halmak are the inspiration for this project. TBN
is made using data collected by [https://github.com/hermitdave/FrequencyWords].
TBN is made using a Genetic Algorithm to determine the most ergonomic and
efficient layout, which is later fine-tuned by the author.

### Parameters

The parameters used to determine the ergonomy and efficiency of the layout is as
follows:

- Travel Distance
- Finger Workload Distribution
- Row Usage
- Left/Right Balance (Hand Alteration)
- Bigram/Trigram Combos (Hand Rolling) Frequency

These parameters will serve as the fitness function within the Genetic Algorithm
